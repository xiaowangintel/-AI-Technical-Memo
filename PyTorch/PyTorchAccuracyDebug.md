# How To Debug Accuracy Issue for PyTorch models
Focus on debugging methods. Don't worry about what your model is, how large your model parameters are and how to get your evaluation score.
In other word, you should be familiar with these before reading this article. 

- Eager Debug
  - Inference
  - train
- Inductor Debug
  - Inference
  - train

## Don't rush to analyze the root cause. `git pull` main component.
you might be in for a pleasant surprise. Yes, you heard that not incorrect. Your accuracy issue may be solved by your colleague.
